<h4 align="center">Welcome to my Java Learning Repository!</h4> 
As I begin learning Java from scratch, I’ve decided to document **everything** I learn — including **code**, **comments**, and **explanations** — directly in the `.java` files.

The goal?  
📘 To help **my future self revise**, and 💡 to **help others** who might be starting their own Java journey!
